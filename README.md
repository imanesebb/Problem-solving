N-Queen Problem
The N-Queen Problem is a classic combinatorial problem in which the goal is to place N queens on an N Ã— N chessboard in such a way that no two queens attack each other.
Problem Explanation
A queen in chess can move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. The challenge is to position N queens on the board such that they do not threaten each other .
in this project, using python as the programing language, i used advanced algorithms(meta heuristics) to find a solution to the N-Queens problem no matter  the number of cases on the board.
